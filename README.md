# Telescope

This guide will outline how to make your own telescope. Supplementary (shitty) drawing and (OK) FreeCAD files are included.

Necessarry tools:
3D printer
Drill
Hand scroll saw or dremel tool

Necessary Supplies:
Cardboard tube (at least 30cm long, 2in diameter)
Super glue
Lenses (I used the Thorlabs LA1116 and LA1256)

Optional tools:
Actual scroll saw
1/4-20 tap
Reamer set
Standard camera tripod

Better supplies:
Large aspheric, achromat lenses (S-LAH64,	AC508-300-Ae, etc.; open your wallet and try not to cry)	

Background:
The goal of this project is to make a telescope capable of seeing Jupiter's moons for less than $100. The magnification of the telescope is given by the ratio of the focal lengths (30x using the suggested lenses.) The brightness of the objects you see is determined by the size of the front (primary) lens. Two inches should suffice for DIY astronomy. The distance between lenses is the sum of their focal lengths (31cm). The overall design is sketched in Fig. 1. 

Fabrication steps:

1. 3D print the stuff.

2. Cut the tube down to 30cm. The reason we cut it short is so that there's some slop in the placement of the objective lens which is accomodated by its long coupling to the tube. This means we don't need precision measurements to achieve good focus. 

3. Using the cutting device, make a few accordian cuts on the objective_round and primary_round pieces. This is so they can expand and reach around the tube. If you experiment with printing different diameters to get an interfence fit with the tube the cuts aren't needed. 

4. Cut three radial lines on the primary_lid so that it can expand to accomodate the primary lens, as depicted in Fig. 2. If you experiment with printing different diameters to get an interfence fit with the lens, the cuts aren't needed. If it's slightly too large, but the lens still rests on the internal lip, then you can just superglue it into place around the edges. In hindhight, it would've been better to design it so that the lenses were just glued on top of circular holes, eliminating all lens precision work. Exercise for the reader, I guess. Design hypothesized in Fig. 3. 

5. Drill out the appropriately sized hole for the objective lens on the objective_lid and insert it. It may take some radial cuts to provide enough slop for the lens to fit depending on your drill tolerances.

6. Slide the round pieces over the tube and then glue the lids to the appropriate sides. If one end of your tube is flat, you can just glue the primary_lid directly to it without worrying about the sleeve.

You now have a finished telescpe. Unfortunately you need a very steady hand to look at anything. To fix this, we mount the telescope to a standart camera tripid.

7. Drill and tap for 1/4-20 in the middle of the mount piece. 

8. Attach the mount piece to the telescope tube using rubber bands or similar, being careful not to distort the tube.

9. You can now attach the telescope to standard camera tripod. Happy stargazing!
